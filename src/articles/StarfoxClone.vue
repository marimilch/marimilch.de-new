        Even today Star Fox for Super Nintendo is one of my favorite games.
        There is action. There is challenge. There are cool characters.
        And the kick-ass music.

            The original game relied on simple 3D graphics to keep the workload
            for the Super FX chip low. That meant remaking the models
            would not be so hard.

            Contrary to the usual workflow, I started with building
            the models instead of the game mechanics. The ship, then some enemies 
            and then the obstacles.

            Half of the time I invested in camera and player controls.
            The other half in the boss. I wanted both to "feel right".

            Ironically the professors didn't get to the boss 
            since they weren't that much of gamers
            themselves. üòÑ

            However my friends did. And killing the boss 
            was the most rewarding experience for them. 
            So it was worth the effort. ‚ù§Ô∏è
