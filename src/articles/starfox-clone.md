# Star Fox in Unity

I learned a lot programming Petraa & The Wolves. But I wanted to present 
something with a little more action and variety.

## Motivation

When I played Star Fox for the first time I
was fascinated with the graphics on the very limited hardware.
With the least amount of polygons every object was still
recognisable without sacrificing any gameplay.
And the kick-ass music.
I knew this had to be the game I wanted to remake and show to the
professors.

## The models

Contrary to the usual workflow, I started with building
the models instead of programming. The ship, then some enemies 
and then the obstacles. As expected it was done fast.

## Mechanics, visuals and logic

After that I invested most of the time in camera and player controls.
It had to "feel right".

The ship never flies forward but instead all the enemies and
obstacles fly toward the camera. Objects far away or not visible
would be disabled. I did this to keep all coordinates
of the objects below 100 - a recommendation by Unity probably
to prevent numerical errors.

To give an additional perception of depth the original version on 
Super Nintendo had either white dots on the ground or if in free space
stars in-game. When I implemented the star emission for the controls
screen I liked the effect so much I added it to the stage as well.

## The Boss

Small enemies and obstacles could easily be copy and pasted.
The boss however required its own programming. It took
the other half development time. And since time 
was getting short already up until then I had to do one
all-nighter before my interview.

## The interview

Ironically when I presented the game to the professors they
didn't get to the boss since they weren't that much of gamers
themselves. üòÑ

However when I let my friends try it out later
killing the boss was the most rewarding experience for them. 
So it was still worth the effort. ‚ù§Ô∏è

## What I learned

Player and enemy are very similar in terms of movement and actions.
The only difference is where both of them receive their input controls.

The funniest "mistake" was probably once the game started to get its
shape I kind of lost track by playing what I'd done so far over and 
over again. I didn't have this problem with Petra & The Wolves. To
me, that's a sign that I should always get inspiration for gameplay
from the most fun classics.

A lot of times I wanted to implement things quick and dirty 
just to rethink and rewrite them later because they
didn't work. I think it's better to opt for a smaller set of things that
actually work than to clash together a buggy mess. It's a lesson I learn and 
probably will always learn again and again:

*Good things take time*.

Thank you for reading this ‚ù§Ô∏è.
