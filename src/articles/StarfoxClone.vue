        Even today Star Fox for Super Nintendo is one of my favorite games.
        There is action. There is challenge. There are cool characters.
        And the kick-ass music.

            The original game relied on simple 3D graphics to keep the workload
            for the Super FX chip low. That meant remaking the models
            would not be so hard.

            Contrary to the usual workflow, I started with building
            the models instead of the game mechanics. The ship, then some enemies 
            and then the obstacles.

            Half of the time I invested in camera and player controls.
            The other half in the boss. I wanted both to "feel right".

    <FancyParagraph title="The interview">
        <p>
            Ironically when I presented the game to the professors they
            didn't get to the boss since they weren't that much of gamers
            themselves. üòÑ
        </p>

        <p>
            However when I let my friends try it out later
            killing the boss was the most rewarding experience for them. 
            So it was worth the effort. ‚ù§Ô∏è

    <FancyParagraph title="What I learned">
        <p>
            Player and enemy are very similar in terms of movement and actions.
            The only difference is where both of them receive their input controls.
        </p>
        <p>
            The funniest "mistake" was probably once the game started to get its
            shape I kind of lost track by playing what I'd done so far over and 
            over again. I didn't have this problem with Petra & The Wolves. To
            me, that's a sign that I should always get inspiration for gameplay
            from the most fun classics.
        </p>
        <p>
            A lot of times I wanted to implement things quick and dirty 
            just to rethink and rewrite them later because they
            didn't work. I think it's better to opt for a smaller set of things that
            actually work than to clash together a buggy mess. It's a lesson I learn and 
            probably will always learn again and again:
